Extremely simple webapp to convert between text and semaphore (in emoji form).

Semaphore characters are represented by two emoji, (assuming signaler is facing you) the first one being the left hand, and the second representing the right.

Site runs entirely within local javascript. I made a little python script to help me quickly create the tables for converting text and emojis, becauase my computer's emoji keyboard is terrible.
